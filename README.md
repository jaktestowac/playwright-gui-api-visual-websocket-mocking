## Overview

Repository contains tests for the following topics:

- **GUI testing**
- **API testing**
- **Visual testing** - pixel-perfect comparison of screenshots between versions
- **Visual testing** + **Masking** - automatic detection of front-end changes and ignoring dynamic elements of the interface
- **WebSocket testing** - testing bidirectional real-time communication
- **Mocking** - mocking API responses and network interactions, simulating various test scenarios and errors, isolating tests from external dependencies

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v20 or later LTS version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- our free application to practice automation - [ü¶é GAD](https://github.com/jaktestowac/gad-gui-api-demo)
- [VSCode] (https://code.visualstudio.com) IDE for coding

## Project Structure

Each test file (with `.spec`extension) contains tests on different levels.

Each test file is fully independent form other so you can modify code without breaking others tests.

Configuration in file `playwright.config.ts` contain all global settings for project.

Debug each test step by step to get deep understanding of test logic.

Pay attention of settings in Playwright Test extension (Testing tab). In PLAYWRIGHT view in SETUP:
Set `Show browser` or `Show trace viewer` options to debug efficiently.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaktestowac/playwright-gui-api-visual-websocket-mocking.git
   cd playwright-gui-api-visual-websocket-mocking
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Optionally install Playwright browsers:

   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

4. Optionally install extensions for VSCode:

Navigate to "Extensions" tab in VSCode, filter extensions using "@recommended" filter

## Running Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Run specific test file:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/example.spec.ts
```

Run tests with UI mode:

```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

Generate test report:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Tests fail on first run**

   - Ensure ü¶é GAD application is running
   - Check if correct Node.js version is installed

2. **Browser launch fails**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```
